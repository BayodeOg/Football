I called a Text interface that says "What is Football to You?"
Which I applied all the necessary modifiers for the Text such as .font(), .fontWeight(), and foregroundStyle
I created a HStack statment that contain the three images since they are horizontally align
Each Image comprises of the systemName and a callout of the image name
I applied all the necessary modifiers such as .resizable(), .scaleToFit(), and .foregroundStyle
